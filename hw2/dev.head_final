this that the the jodo shinshu of name of view , has the times with changed . shows
after shinran died , it was an independent jodo shu from religion as . formed
though the the shinran of teachings of successors the that their own doctrine the true to jodo going for teaching was feeling had , they themselves just that time at shinshu because themselves jodo shinshu could be jodo shu of denial as interpreted naming . named
the jodo and jodo shu shinshu between the whether or not the shinran lineages could themselves " jodo shinshu " was shumei ronso , which 15 1774 from years for lasted called name question over . conflict

the jurakudai of construction february 1586 in , an and an official , who ( chief the emperor to ) , a chief the emperor to councilor advisor kanpaku became hideyoshi of residence office as , and 1586 september in completed . began
after hideyoshi kyushu conquered , he jurakudai into osaka from to political affairs administer . moved
also , he an audience tensho shonen ( ' boys envoys to the tensho era during europe ) shisetsu to and ieyasu tokugawa in jurakudai . gave
although being " " ( tei / house ) meaning -dai called , jurakudai fact in a a plain on castle , since it several enclosed such a a castle the center in and a secondary it around enclosure tower with donjon as areas included , and was a moat with surrounded . was
jurakudai within , 's hideyoshi aides for , sen houses no rikyu et al. were . built

1594 in , hideyoshi fushimi-jo his his retirement after residence for castle of construction , and 1595 in , because an adverse hideyoshi with relationship of , hidetsugu was mt to sent . began and then koya-san to suicide commit , thereafter jurakudai was demolished . ordered
it is that jurakudai was once " uchino " ( or no onkamae uchino ) okamai , which first " tamon-in " ( the tamon-in temple of diary ) nikki in appears construction during called , the february 27 of , 1586 section in known , ' the uchino okamai of construction the last 21st on . began '

since no other sources have been so far found , historians generally that the " " juraku term was hideyoshi by created . believe
there no recognizable jurakudai of today remaining structure , that the landscape its mark bears except . is

the " " shijin-so-o term the and land physiognomy that are traditionally to the best the ' four ' that the four the , korea and japan china in heavens of directions govern gods for suited be believed topography to . refers
the four an ' ' ( yellow dragon ) or kirin their center at oryu with gods are the ' ' ( five gods ) go-jin . called
however , the the four and actual geography japan in gods between correspondence greatly that from china in , south korea , and north korea . differs
shijin-so-o the feng and korea china of shui in topography the ( wind and collecting storing ) which in the terrain is tall mountains the ( haizan-rinsui back at having by enclosed ) water , a , river , or sea the ( ) sui front in lake , and smaller or ( ) sa mountains both sides on hills zofujusui of form . indicates
however , ogura-ike pond was completely , which the shijin-so-o kyoto of topography broke landfills by . consumed
. mt , which once suzaku-oji avenue overlooked , funaoka a little too genbu for small . is
the standard feng , mt shui of viewpoint . in funaoka is seiho as , which to , a mountains of dragon , sanryu is genbu via headed . interpreted
modern japan in , the that the four gods are ' , river , road and lake mountain to , ' as the following table in shown related interpretation , is generally . accepted
however , this association has not necessarily been ancient times since . settled
the " sakuteiki gardening " book the that the four gods ' , river , road and lake mountain to equates theory of source . is '
it also that certain trees of kinds planting can ' the four gods , river , road and ' the event in lake mountain there no mountain , , road and to the four gods represent lake river is = substitute . explains
the that the four gods are ' , river , road and lake mountain ' to related interpretation has been generally modern japan in , the seiryu = kamo-gawa ( the yodo-gawa river ) system , byakko = sanin-do road , suzaku = ogura-ike and genbu pond = mt river of association since . accepted funaoka relatively a model as heian-kyo with successful . was
therefore , we to attention the that there no the the that this theory the ideological the land , which was the late eighth century in built heian-kyo for choosing for background is assumption on based argument of proof is fact to pay . need
fact in , even though a the edo period to prior city would have been to the shijin-so-o topography match designed , it very unlikely that the four gods , river , road and lake mountain were . is
right now , the heijo of place the four beasts of painting with accordance in ; three mountains things , and turtle augury the same tells assuage . is '
the ' the four beasts of painting with ' accordance here phrase shijin-so-o , which that the nara heijo-kyo period during was to the shijin-so-o topography having place be considered confirms topography . means
the heijo-kyo doesn of location 't a , river , road and lake mountain to as heian-kyo for described . apply
however , as as it is shijin-so-o topography with associated long it likely that another interpretation would have been the nara period during accepted . is
shirin saiyo-sho the late kamakura period in commentary that ' the central mountains are genbu to , and the , panoply and oven people are to suzaku related ... , ' which that suzaku was ' people with , panoply and oven associated shows related . mentions '
moreover , " ryueihikan " that ' the edo castle the the 's world castle of position , and its land merit of winds with shijin-so-o topography ' coincides . mentions
it to that such geography the ' four gods of theory = , river , road and mountain lake matches say far-fetched . is '
furthermore , the that castle himeji interpretation , fukuyama ( bingo-no-kuni ) or kumamoto castle castle the shijin-so-o ' , river , road and lake mountain ' later emerged theory of topography . matches
there no certain fortune of a certain the feng ancient china of shui in direction on concept , so it an original japanese to kimon abhor ( the northeast of direction , an ogre gate ) called and urakimon ( the southwest of which the opposite kimon of side is ) direction concept is . is
this how the shijin-so-o topography of interpretation has ancient times from the early modern times to , and it is to and the feng ancient china of shui from different unique be believed changed . is
